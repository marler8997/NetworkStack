Things I Don't Like

Initializing Modules
The tcpip_init function takes a callback that is called when it is done.
I'm not sure I like this, I don't see any real advantages.
The disadvantage is that it increases memory on the program stack (may or may not be good),
also it prevents creating a custom interface from the caller of tcpip_init and the handler
without resorting to global data. For example, if you want to call tcpip_init from the main
function and want the handler to return a return code, you will need to keep track of the return
code in a global variable (instead of just having the handler return the code).

there should be a blocking version of initializing modules
i.e. void tcpip_init_block();



tcp_new
There should be a way to create specific tcp pcbs.  Adding a function like
tcp_new_listener should remedy this.

mbox
The size of the mbox is passed in before the mbox type is allocated.
The sys_arch should be able to define the function to allocate the
memory for the mailbox and that function should also have the size of the mbox.

In general, allocating the custom types should be customizable.
